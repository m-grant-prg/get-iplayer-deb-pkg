This package uses quilt in order to apply patches to the upstream source.  
Patches are stored in debian/patches. For further details, see the man page for 
quilt.

All commands described below should be run from the top directory of the 
package source tree, unless otherwise stated.

 * To generate the fully patched source, in a form ready for editing, that 
   would be built to create Debian packages, run: 
 
     export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
     quilt push -a

 * To modify the source and save those modifications so that they will be 
   applied when building the package, pick a suitably informative patch file 
   name, for example Modify_README.source, and then run:

     export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
     quilt new Modify_README.source
     quilt edit README.source

   This will place you in your default editor to modify the file.
   Once your are done editing, save the file and run:

     quilt refresh

 * To remove source modifications that are currently being applied when 
   building the package, run:

     export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
     quilt top
